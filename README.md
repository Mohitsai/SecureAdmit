   The presentation is **updated** with the potential fixes and changes to project based on the feedback (specifically playing around with the public signals of the circom circuit to make the 
   application more robust to any data integrity issues) received during the discussion.

## Instructions to run :

Open three terminals in the three different directories of the project which represent the three different components of the project :

1. Testing Organization
   a) Navigate to '**testingOrganization**' directory in the first terminal.
   b) Run the command '**python app.py**'.
   c) Install flask and pandas with **pip install flask** and  **pip install flask** if flask and pandas modules are not available in your system.
   d) Navigate to -> **http://127.0.0.1:5000** on your browser.
   e) With the authentication information found in the student_authentication.csv, login and get access to students' scores and merkle proofs generated by the testing organization.
2. University Application for Admissions
   a) Make sure the browser in which you would prefer to access the university application has **metamask wallet** installed and the browser extension added.
   b) Also make sure that the chain that the wallet is connected to is the **sepolia testnet chain**.
   c) Now Navigate to '**universityApplication**' directory in your second terminal.
   d) Run the command '**npm run dev**'.
   e) Make sure all node modules are available, incase of any errors first run npm install and then run npm run dev.
   f) Navigate to -> **http://localhost:3000** in the browser that you have metamask wallet installed on and on the sepolia testnet chain.
   g) This will instantly take you to a screen to authenticate to connect to metamask wallet.
   h) Once connected you can interact with the university's application with student information that you accessed from the previous component.
3. University side
   a) Navigate to '**universitySide**' directory in the first terminal.
   b) Run the command 'python -m http.server 8000'
   c) Access the university side student details from a browser like above by navigating to -> **http://localhost:8000/app.html**
